# Waitercaller
Waitercaller is a flask app that allows restaurant-goers to notice waiters when they need attention to the table.
This is a project that I do following a chapter in the book Flask: Building Python Web Services by Gareth et al(2017). The project is written mostly in Python, with a touch of Javasript.
At the time of building the project, I used the newest versions of all the tools and technologies that are used in the book, thus the code is slightly different to make it compatible with the test environment.
In this project, I learned to:
  - Use Bootstrap in Flask
  - Create User Account Control with Flask-Login extension
  - Implement secure password storage in Python
  - Shorten URLs using the bitly API
  - Connect MongoDB with Flask by Pymongo
  - Build CRUD operations in Flask
